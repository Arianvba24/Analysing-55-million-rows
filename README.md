# Analysing-55-million-rows
In this project we'll analyse the reviews from a website that has been active since 1996 and has a total of 55130430

Thats a lot!

We can't use Power BI or other Python librearies in order to analyse the data. Literally Power BI lasts like 6 min in only read the data and using Pandas better say anything...

So we will **C++** and **Java** powered libraries like DuckDB and PySpark :)

Due to files size we were not allowed to upload it here(not even Google Drive).

You can ask me for the files in my Fiverr profile:
